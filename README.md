<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<h3>Don't trust 100% the leak check, try it yourself as well and the linked tester below</h3>
<h3>Try to write your own test first and don't just run a tester mindlessly</h3>
<h3>You don't have to pass all the cases in this tester</h3>
<h3>If you want to check leaks outside of your manual checking:</h3>

[This is good one to check valgrind](https://github.com/thallard/minishell_tester)
<h3>A bit more time to set it up, but worth it</h3>
<h3>The first time if you run the tester above and expect a lot of errors</h3>
<h3>Then redirect each of the output from stdin and strerror to a file otherwise you won't be able see all of the errors</h3>

<h1>How To Use</h1>
<h3>First you should comment out everything what prints to terminal eg "exit" at exit, printf's for debugging etc</h3>
<h3>Then modify your main loop:</h3>
<h3>You should only read with readline and use your own prompt when you launch the program by yourself typing ./minihsell into the terminal, you can check it this way:</h3>
</div>

```c
	if (isatty(fileno(stdin)))
		shell->prompt = readline(shell->terminal_prompt);
```

<h3 align=center>Else if it is opened by another program/tester for example then use gnl as follows</h3>

```c
	char *line;
	line = get_next_line(fileno(stdin));
	shell->prompt = ft_strtrim(line, "\n");
	free(line);
```

<h3 align=center>So it should look like something like this:</h3>

```c
	if (isatty(fileno(stdin)))
		shell->prompt = readline(shell->terminal_prompt);
	else
	{
		char *line;
		line = get_next_line(fileno(stdin));
		shell->prompt = ft_strtrim(line, "\n");
		free(line);
	}
```

<h3>I think from this you pretty much can figure it out, it isn't a big change :)</h3>
