<h1>How To Use</h1>
<h3>First you should comment out everything what prints to terminal eg "exit" at exit</h3>
<h3>Then modify your main loop:</h3>
<h3>You should only read with readline and use your own prompt when you launch the program by yourself typing ./minihsell into the terminal, you can check it this way:</h3>
</div>

```c
	if (isatty(fileno(stdin)))
		shell->prompt = readline(shell->terminal_prompt);
```

<h3 align=center>Else if it is opened by another program/tester for example then use gnl as follows</h3>

```c
	char *line;
	line = get_next_line(fileno(stdin));
	shell->prompt = ft_strtrim(line, "\n");
	free(line);
```

<h3 align=center>So it should look like something like this:</h3>

```c
	if (isatty(fileno(stdin)))
		shell->prompt = readline(shell->terminal_prompt);
	else
	{
		char *line;
		line = get_next_line(fileno(stdin));
		shell->prompt = ft_strtrim(line, "\n");
		free(line);
	}
```

<h3>I think from this you pretty much can figure it out, it isn't a big change :)</h3>
<h2>How to launch the tester</h2>
<h3>Clone it to the root of your minishell</h3>
<h3>cd to the testers folder</h3>

```

<h3>options: m, b, a</h3>
<h3>Feel free to ask on slack if you have a question</h3>
<h3>Or open a pull request if you would like to add more test</h3>
<h3>Looking for people who would like to add more tests to the bonus part, because we haven't done it</h3>
